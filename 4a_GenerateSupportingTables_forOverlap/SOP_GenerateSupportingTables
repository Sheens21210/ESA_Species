When Spatial libraries are considered locked for a given overlap update Steps 4 a, b c - Notes withing the directories
will prompt what steps can be run simultaneously

Step 4a:

 Step A - Time estimate ~ 3 hours
 Time estimate per species ~ 1-15 minutes per species except flowering plant which takes 2.5 hours
 Flowering plants takes a very long time to generate- one the script reaches this species group it can be
 re-started to create the other species group files while flowering plants completes

 Step B- Check for missing species against the master list for range files only - checks for missing species happen
 several other places

 Step C - Start 4B

 Step D - Time estimate ~ 10hours
 Intersect Regions intersect regions, explodes and dissolves to generate multipart polygons specific to certain regions

 Step E -
    Projects geographic output from Step D into Web Mercator to get the acres for the full range- web mercator
    TODO clean up script - can be streamlined
    Use the 2 dissolve file from Step D - the one that has been exploded, regions assigned then dissolved - polygons in
    regions are separate from each other

 Step F - Acres tables
    Generates acres table- for each species you will have the acres from each region where it occurs; the region
    region specific value is in the projection for that region; the total acres value is from the web mercator file
    generated in Step E and is in a projected web mercator

 Step G- L48/NL48
    places species into L48/NL48 or both for sorting; will also note the number of NL48 regions where the species is
    found

 Step H- Converts acres to another area unit

Step  4B - is delayed to Step C because 4a E takes so long:

 Step 1a - updates ATT tables of merged composite files  to master list

 Step 2 -  Time estimate ~ 15 hours
    Union composite files; and generate the list of species included in each union
        TODO clean up of flowering plants takes the longest- finding a way to do this more quickly would speed up the
        process; this can be done in arcpy by hiding the fields in ArcMap then exporting the file- quicker than current
        logic in python

    Union files to be used in overlap runs - union so no one location on the ground is run more than once
    step b- add unique key ZoneID used as key in overlap
    ** NOTE NOTE** After union finishes compare list of species included in union to make master to make sure no species
    were missed
    2a- generates just the union list of species by species group to from union file to compare to master list
        **NOTE species that are miss are difficult to add back in - done by adding a fake species group - generating
        comp file- and changing species group in master list; to update a species range same logic can be following by
        species must be removed from all zone in original union file FIRST - done manually

 Step 3 - Time estimate ~ 3 hours
    Clips union-ed composite file to land - Flowering plants takes the longest, once this files starts you can start a second
    instance of the script and it will skip to the other species files
        **Note note** be sure to populate the ZoneID field before clip! ZoneID=ObjectID of un-clipped files, Zones may
        drop when clipped to land and the objectID cannot be used as a look up for species or for a join

 Step 4 - Time estimate 12 hours
    convert union polygons to raster - cannot have multiple instances of script running due to schema locks
    snap raster for conversion must be a NAD 83 geographic project with 30 meter cells; default cell is very large;
    typical use the cult mask from current cdl

 Step 5- Time estimate ~ 72 hours if all regions are done separately; run CONUS on its one and split other; esp AK to
    Speed up
    Projects rasters into region projections
    only zones in region are included - use snap raster specific to region
    Run different regions at a time to make this go faster; specifically run the regions that do not need to be
    re-projected; the others may have schema lock errors for the re-projection into WGS; causing region to be run twice.
    WGS re-projection does full file, individual file will one be in the region
    #TODO Check if the WGS in needed

 Step 6- Time estimate 3.5 hours CH 9.5 Range
    coverts geodatabase raster to GRIDs
    Done to avoid schema locks from gdb when working with rasters found in the same region
    be aware files name length is limit is short - be sure to check for extra _ or spaces in file name - there should
    not be an _ at the end of the file name
    **Note - these names are used as IDs for naming output tables and joining back the
    union file to covert from result by zone to result by species**
