Description : For  Step_A1_splitHUC2_A_B.py and Step_A2_splitHUC2_A_B_Summarize.py

Generates Point file with annual precipitation is used to make the HUC2 a/b splits based on the precipitation points
found within the HUC12. If not point is within the HUC12 the closest point is used.  This table is joined back to the
NHD seamless data set by HUC12 to set the a/b splits for the HUC2. Area in  HI, AS, and CNMI outside the NHD boundaries
were assigned the HUC2 of 22 - these need to be included so these locations are found in the intersect species composite
input files.

Point information is extracted from the original data sources described below, projection into a distance projection and
merged to a single file. This merged file is the input for  Step_A1_splitHUC2_A_B.py

Used projection that preserves distance  : North_America_Equidistant_Conic ;WKID: 102010 Authority: Esri;
Projection: Equidistant_Conic ; Transformation: NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_1 (if needed)

**used a NAD83 because NHDPlus is NAD83

Updated :Moved from North_America_Equidistant_Conic when adding HI

Original Data sources:
See Ryan email to Chuck on 10/7/2016 forward to me on 10/12/2016 - included below
L48: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/climate-normals/1981-2010-normals-data
Raw data is not being used.  The values were interpolated to a grid and those are the location used.
Data represent 30 years- 1982-2010
daily values were normalized and then summarized to get an annual precipitation values - see excel sheet
mly_prcp_climo_geo.xlsx - folder spring 2017
This information was the interpolate into 5km intervals across the L48 and exported to a csv.  This is the files used to
generate point file. We did not use the IDW as it was generating and interpolated surface from something that was
already interpolated.

Hi Chuck,

Below is a brief description of the process I used to estimate HUC-2 precipitation regions. I've also attached a map
and the precipitation data.

The data I used comes from NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information (formerly the National Climate
Data Center). I used the latest (1981 – 2010) 30-year precipitation normals. See the link below for information on the d
ata set and availability of other 30-year periods.

http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/land-based-station-data/land-based-datasets/climate-normals/1981-2010-normals-data

I ordered the data through Mike Squires (mike.squires@noaa.gov). He sent a csv file containing 469,758 grid points
spaced at 5km intervals across the lower 48 (attached). I imported the grid to GIS and applied an Inverse Distance
Weighted interpolation (IDW) tool to generate a continuous surface map. IDW is one of a few available interpolation
tools; another may be more appropriate. I clipped the resulting raster to the HUC-2 regions and adjusted the symbology
to generate a map (attached) which could be adjusted to represent the different precipitation regions (17a/17b). Once
set, the regions could be reclassified to True/False and run against a HUC-12 map.

Have a good long weekend - talk to you next week!
(What is the phone number we are using for the 10am meeting on Tuesday?)

This data source was used rather than the one from the L48 per recommendation from NMFS

Update Spring 2018 - tabular data downloaded on 6/11/2018 - save to spring 2018 folder in AquModeling directory
HUC12s are now available for HI precipitation data will be used to make the a/b split
-Raw Monthly data was download from the above site
-Filtered to include the same 30 years as the L48
-Filtered so only stationA with 12 months of data for a given year are include
-Average month value calculation across year
-Sum of average monthly values is the annual value
-Annual value in inches used for point file to make the a/b split
- Station mark as -9999 by author not included in final point file
- station with a negative value for annual precipitation was updated using the authors annual value which may include
additional years
