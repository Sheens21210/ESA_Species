After overlap runs are complete raw results are will be transformed from pixel counts by distance to percent overlap by
distance interval

Key variable - Acres tables need to be locked to get to percentage; Need buy in chemical team on look-up table

Key Tracking : Root folder for output file locations need to remain consistent for all runs.  File structure
is automated.   Look-up table should have buy in from chemical team

Step 1 - Generate list of all uses names useing the file structure generated in the overlap runs
   - use to generate the look-up table for the chemical; ie what uses are needed, max drift, application method ext
Step 2-  Transforms table from zones to species, and convert numbers from pixels to percentage
Step 3 - Breaks tables into the desired distance interval - default 30m
Step 4- Generates the summary tables for the BE - ie direct use overlap, overlap for ground and aerial
Step 5- Collapses table across regions
