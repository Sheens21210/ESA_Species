############### User input variables
Input Sources: User driven,  UpdatedBins_[date].csv  from Step_1_UpdateBinTable_RangeUpdate or
Current_Bins_tobeLoadDB_[date].csv from Step_2_UpdateBinTable_BinAssignments,

############### General Notes:
Included a few checks to make sure when the table loads, the bin assignment columns loads as integers, default they
would load one decimal place floats.

Verify dictionary that that updates the bin code to shorthand is correct; and that all reassigned code are captured in
list.

Verify logic for downstream dilution assignments hasn't changed

**Check output table for errors in the dynamically populated columns**

# ############## ASSUMPTIONS
1) Maintaining huc specific assignments, typically this happens for the marine bins when a species is found in coastal
and land-locked hucs
2) Bin columns ['Terrestrial Bin', 'Bin 1', 'Bin 2', 'Bin 3', 'Bin 4', 'Bin 5', 'Bin 6', 'Bin 7', 'Bin 8', 'Bin 9',
Bin 10'] are continuous. DF is split using index position and not column names - Note if this is
problem this can be changed to column names if needed
3) Column order has not changed since Step 1
########################################################################################################################

# Step 1: load data from current bin tables, splits species info and database info into their own data frame using index
# location of bin cols.  To split the df this way it is assumed that cols are in the correct order in the current bin
# table.  Done by index rather than hard code this way so we change the supporting columns without impacting the code.

Loads table to data frame, drops unnamed columns, sets bins columns values to integers,secondary check in function using
.replace to make sure bin codes load as integer. Populated the ['Reassigned'] columns using by check for the values in
the reassigned list for each row of data.

# Step 2: Break coded bin table into three parts, species info (leading_col), bin info (bins) and trailing_col (database
# info for tracking updates to assignment

Separates data frame into three parts, species info cols, bins, and database info columns.  Note this is an assumption
that the columns on the input table are in the correct order; the split is done by index position. Used index position
so we could change the columns without having to change the code.

# Step 3:Update of of the bins codes to shorthand description based on DB_code_Dict dictionary

Changes the bin code to shorthand. Be sure to verify the shorthand for each bin is correct

# Step 4: Merge the species info, bins and database info back into one df

Merges the three split data frames back into one

# Step 5: Populated the MultiHUC and sur_HUC columns based on species/huc combos in working_df; all HUC2 that start with
# 22 (pacific islands) use 21 (HI) has surrogate

Populates the MultiHUC and sur HUC columns for each row based one which and how much HUC2 the species is found in.

# Step 6: Drop columns added during processing, and drop any duplicate row in data frame

Drops columns that were added during processing and to any duplicate rows for a species. The duplicate row occur when a
number of HUC2 where change to the same surrogate HUC2.

# Step 7: Flag Downstream dilution species

Add a Yes/No column to note a downstream dilution species based on criteria in flag_dd_species.

# Step 8:Filters the list to the species on the current master. Exports filter data frame to csv in root folder, export
# unfiltered table to archived folder
