# Steps 1 4 are completed ont he usage overlap output results
# Step 2 is then used as inpute for Step 2a ofr 7b
# Step 2 is use as inputs for Step 2b of 7B
# TODO Will need to make a table that is used for Step 1 and Step of 7b that excludes elevation

Step A: - updates summer 2018 changed overlap run to Tabulate area from Zonal histogram due to processing time of
zonal histogram with the combined input files

Scripts in 5_RunOverlap - use TabulalteArea scripts not Zonal
    Run overlap on the political boundaries using Step3_RunOverlap_usage_boundaries. This information is needed to
    do the state adjustments of use within the species range and use outside the species range.
        - Run time ~ 2 hours/ use split into groups to speed up
        -TODO find lost scratch path - temp files saving in current directory

    Run Overlap to species input files with the additional information added during the combine
        - Run time ~ NL48 takes a couple of hours to run combined input files, L48 CH tales be 1.5 -10 mins for a use
        depending on species (ch_fishes is the longest; range takes between 8 hours and 1 hour per use (r_birds longest)
        split up uses and or species input to speed up


 Step B: Create master input files for species, extracting the species by entity ID, HUCS, Elevation, Habitat, FIPS and
 STATEs
    From 7a_ TabulateUsage_MinMax
        1_CreateUsageOverlapTables_PolBoundaries_TabArea- add area and column and sums by fips and state then exports
        tables to Counties and state folder with all uses rather than use layer folder

        1_B tranforms table from zone to species

        update 1C to pull in pull species parent table for filter table , aqu, ele, hab, hab, elevation
            # TODO acres of species range filtered category
        1_D Merged the AQU tables into one with the use layers across the top and species in the cols include % ares
        of huc - see schemia in OneNote
            # TODO $ of species range in huc/state combo
        run step 2 - adjust the species by state based on PCT - pulls in parent species table and political usage
        overlap
            #TODO do we need to adjust for redunacy first; I can pull the factors from the unadjust table then apply them
         Step 3: generated parent drift tables for each filter category
         Step 4: generates the 'all uses' table for each filter category

      Run 7b: step 2a and 2b
        # run for each parent table generate ie, elevation, elevation usage min, max, averaage, lower, upper, uniform etc
        # TODO set up to use the file name to put to the correct out file directory
