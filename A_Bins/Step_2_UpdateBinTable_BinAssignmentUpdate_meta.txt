############### User input variables
Input Sources: User driven, Services, UpdatedBins_[date].csv  from Step_1_UpdateBinTable_RangeUpdate

############### General Notes:
Before running this update table must be codes to match the current bin database codes

This step can be skipped if using collapsed species bin assignment as surrogate for new spe/huc2 combos; this *will not*
account for new species

# ############## ASSUMPTIONS
1) Species bin assignment found in the in_update_table have been manually recode to match the current bins DB bin codes
2) New Species/HUC combos are represented in the species range
3) Final columns headers are the same as those in current_wide
4) Current_wide has cols in the desired order

Step 1: load data from current bin tables, and tables used for update

Loads input tables, updated species entity ids as needed, standardized the columns headers to current_wide headers,
add Spe_HUC column to all tables to be used as unique ID of species/HUC2 combinations; notes which species info columns
in the table with bin updates may have dated information.  Generates a data frame with species info from current master
that the user wants to include in final output.  This

Step 2: Add updated assignment for species/huc2 combos found on the in_update_table

Updated the working df to include the updates found in the in_update_table.  NOTE assumption is the range files are
final for this round of updates before running step 1.  Any spe/huc2 combo added at this point IS NOT found in the range
file.  These additions are exported to an intermediate table.

Step 3: Removes old species information and appends species information from current master list

Step 4: Append current species info based on user input

Step 5: Exports data frame to csv
