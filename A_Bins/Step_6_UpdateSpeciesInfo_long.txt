# ##############General notes
# All hard coded columns are purposefully, these are new columns used for tracking
# Before running this make sure WoE have not been changes since they were updated during Step 1 or 2
# Output: LongBins_PP_filter_AB_[date].csv goes to [C.Peck] to be incorporated into the post-processor
# In Step_7_long_to_wide; there is another check for duplicates; of duplicates are found these tables should be updated

############### User input variables
Input Sources: User driven, LongBins_unfiltered_AB_[date].csv from Step_5_A_B_split,

# ############## ASSUMPTIONS
1) Col order has not changed since step 1
2) Long bin table is used a master for entity id and huc2 header names
3) Master huc12/ab split is used for huc12 columns names
4) Col header in long bin table should be used out output header for final data frame
5) Woe groups have not changes since they were updated in Step 1 or Step 2 NOTE can add loop in to also make update to
WoE groups

# Step 1: Load data from current bin tables;  Sets the columns from the species tables that should be included in the
# output bin tables.

Loads input tables, standardized the columns headers to input table and master species table headers, generates data
frame with updated species info from active master species table

# Step 2: Removes old species info from bin data frame then merges the new species info to the bin data frame and runs
# reindex on out cols

Slices working data frame to include just bin information and the species identifier (entityid); removing old supporting
species information. Merges the bin data frame to the updated species info data frame on the species identifier column.
Reindex col order to match user input

# Step 3: Updated lead agency code to agency abbreviations;

Add in flags to allow output table to be filtered to view species w/o rage, new hucs, and removed species

# Step 4: Filters working data frame to a filter and unfiltered version. Unfiltered includes all bins and all values,
# filter includes just Bins 2-10 and bins where species are located.  Filtered version used as input for post-processor

# Step 5: Exports data frame to csv
# used to make a wide version of the A/B splits; should be the same as long_bins unless species info updated
# LongBins_unfiltered_AB_[date].csv
# LongBins_PP_filter_AB_[date].csv # Filters to 'yes' just bins 2-10; Used as input for post-processor
