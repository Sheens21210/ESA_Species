Time line to complete update: ~ 6 Months from when updated master species list in locked- See outlined time line
Time line Assumptions: Range files updates (~3 Months) and Bin assignment (~1 month) received on time; Troubleshooting
new Range composites and HUC2 assignments to new composites is minimal

Purpose: Incorporate the updates to the species HUC and bin assignments, change may be to the huc 2 based on a spatial
range change or to the bin assignment.  During each update all support species information such as listing status, WoE
group etc will updated to match the current master species list.  New species are add to the table and removed species
are filtered.  All removed species an associated bin information will be retained in the archived, just removed for the
active table.

Output file structure:

The table_folder variable is the path to the folder where all output tables will be saved. This variable needs to remain
static the entire update. Within the output folder there needs to be an [Archived] folder where all input tables used
for the update need to be saved and  all intermediate and record keeping tables, ie bin assignments for removed species,
will be saved located.  The updated coded bin assignment table,[UpdatedBins[date].csv]  finalized at the end of step 2
should be loaded into the bin tracking database. [LongBins_PP_filter_AB_[date].csv], end of Step 6,goes to [C.Peck] to
be incorporated into the Post Processor. [WideBins_unfiltered_AB_[date].csv] end of step 7 used as bin able for BE
attachment.

Key Assumptions:
***Coded bins values are hierarchical, a higher number trumps a lower number when collapsing***

Before the Bin update can be started:
1) Range composite files will need to be finalized
2) Species/HUC12 crosswalk will need to be generated
3) ESA WOE groups crosswalk used by post processor

Documents/Tools dependant on output from update:
1) Update to bin tracking database (Current_Bins_tobeLoadDB_[date].csv from Step 2
2) Post-Processor (LongBins_PP_filter_AB_[date].csv from Step 6
3) Active Bin table used in BE documents (WideBis_unfiltered_AB_[date].csv from Step 7
4) Updates to WoE/MagTool

Time line to complete update: ~ 6 Months from when updated master species list in locked
Step 1: Date to lock master list set by team
1) Lock master species list with support species information
1) Set date on when update Range files need to be received
4) Add HUCs for a species based on range updates
5) Removed HUCs for a species based on range updates

Step 2: 2 weeks from date due date for updated Range files- typically 3 months from locking master species list
2) Finalize Range composite files and HUC12 crosswalks from theses files.
2) Update ESA WOE groups crosswalk used by post processor

Step 3: 2 Weeks from when Step 2 is complete
Assumption: Time estimate includes 1.5 weeks of troubleshooting of new range composite files
3)Run HUC2 for the update range files

Step 4: 1 Day from when final crosswalks (HUC12/WoE groups- Step 2) and final HUC2 change tables (Step 3) are received
4) Update HUC2 assignments in the current bin table
4) Submit species without an bin assignment to Services for review- brand new species or new HUC2 add

Step 5: 3 weeks from when the Services provided updated bin assignments- typically 1 month after sending the request
Assumption - Time estimate includes 2.5 weeks to address questions on the updates received  by Services.

5) Incorporate Services feedback
5) Load the updated coded bin table to the bin tracking database
5) Complete remaining steps for bin update
5) Provide post-processor table to [C. Peck] to be loading into Post Processor tool
5) Provide table used for BE Attachment to [J.Connolly] to be finalized for chemical

General Notes:
Starting input tables that need to be moved to [Archived] folder at the table_folder location:
1) Master species list
2) ESA WoE group crosswalk (long format)
3) HUC2 a/b assignment by HUC12
4) Species HUC12 crosswalks
5) HUC2 added and removed tables

Step 1 and 2:
User must set boolean variables :collapse_huc and collapse_new_HUCS_only

If just only collapse_huc all species will multiple will hucs will be collapsed to single bin assignments applied to
each HUC. (NOTE: HUC specific assignments will be lost)

If both are set to true, when a new HUC is added for a species with a bin assignments for other HUCs, a bin assignment
will  be generated that include all bins.

Cannot set collapse_huc to False if you want to generate a bin assignment to for the new hucs by collapsing.

Species information is updated on active coded bin assignment table, identifying new species without any bin assignment
and species with new HUC2 with a bin assignment that is collapsed from all other HUC2s
    - UpdatedBins[date].csv [Updated] column
        1) Species without a range file - New Species
        2) Species with an added huc and a bin assignment collapsed from previously assigned HUCS with a huc specific
        bin assignment - [New HUC add - Collapsed, huc specific bin assignments]
        3) Species with an added huc and a bin assignment collapsed from previously assigned HUCS, no huc specific bin
         assignments - [New HUC add - Collapsed, No, huc specific bin assignments]
        4) Collapsed all HUCs to a single bin assignment with a huc specific bin assignment - [All hucs collapsed,
        included huc -specific bin assignments]
        5) Collapsed all HUCs to a single bin assignment without a huc specific bin assignment - [All hucs collapsed,
        no huc specific bin assignments]
    -  UpdatedBins[date].csv column immediately following the EntityID column
        1) Make note of a species that has been removed from the current master list.  Bin assignment and EntityID will
        still be found in table  but the species supporting information.  Archived of dropped species with species
        with species supporting information can be found in the DroppedSpecies_[date].csv table

All bin assignments for new species and new HUCs should be verified by the Services.
    - Table Species_w_NewHUC2_[date].csv will have all species with new huc 2s
    - UpdatedBins_[date].csv can be filtered using update column. Boolean variables collapse_huc and
    collapse_new_HUCS_only variable allows user to generate bin assignments for species with a new huc based on the
    previous assigned hucs.

Steps 3-7

Converts bins codes to shorthand description,  transforms format from wide to long, long format needed for
post-processor, applies HUC2 a/b split based on species HUC12 crosswalks, updates all species information, transform
table with shorthand back to wide format for use as BE attachment
