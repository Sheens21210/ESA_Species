When composite file are finalize and use layer shaev been moved to library in the correct projection
the overlap runs can be started; output raw overlap for each use site by region, species group

Key variable - Use layers and Species files are in the same projections; cell size for use layer is identified
Updates will need to occur if: use  layer or species range files change, projection is off

Key Tracking : Root folder for output file locations need to remain consistant for all runs.  File structure
is automated.

# TODO set up so output folder name is read in from table - makeing consitant folder name is tricky due to variation in
# Use layer names

** Prior to running the overlap Symbology layers should be updated - this will be variable used in an number of place
** Be sure to update the snap raster dictionary as well
***KEY ASSUMPUTION All uselayer must start with the projection name follow by the regions abbreviation or CDL and then
the use with the _euc if is distance raster

Step 1 - General overlap for species range and CH composites; can be used for varied unique IDs; ie ZoneID, InterID etc
    - Runs by region
    - Run multiple regions at the same time - regions takes less time than CONUS ~ 1.5 hours per use for CONUS
        - To speed up CONUS runs use the sub-set use variable and run the uses in groups rather than the whole gdb
    - Output is pixel count distance is row wise zone for species is column wise
Step 2- Overlap for aquatic species based on catchment:
    - Runs by region
    -Output is pixel count catchment ID is row wise and disance is column wise - transformed so there wouldn't be
    millions of columns  easier to have millions of row
    #TODO - update needs to be finalized for Step 2 needs;; can we simplify?
Step 2b- Overlap for aquatic species based HUC12:
    - Runs by region
    - Original overlap for NHD when just doing HUC - likely will be archived
        - NOTE HAS NOT BEEN updated if we start to use this one again inputs should be streamlined to match others
        in this tool

Step 3 - Run overlap against political boundaries used for usage :
    - Only need for usage

Step 4 - Place holder for running a vector use:
    # TODO finished this script then update table automation to account for a vector use
