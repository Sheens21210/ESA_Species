# Steps 1 4 are completed ont he usage overlap output results
# Step 2 is then used as inpute for Step 2a ofr 7b
# Step 2 is use as inputs for Step 2b of 7B
# TODO Will need to make a table that is used for Step 1 and Step of 7b that excludes elevation

Step A: - updates summer 2018 changed overlap run to Tabulate area from Zonal histogram due to processing time of
zonal histogram with the combined input files

Scripts in 5_RunOverlap - use TabulalteArea scripts not Zonal
    Run overlap on the political boundaries using Step3_RunOverlap_usage_boundaries. This information is needed to
    do the state adjustments of use within the species range and use outside the species range.
        - Run time ~ 2 hours/ use split into groups to speed up
        -TODO find lost scratch path - temp files saving in current directory

    Run Overlap to species input files with the additional information added during the combine
        - Run time ~ NL48 takes a couple of hours to run combined input files, L48 CH tales be 1.5 -10 mins for a use
        depending on species (ch_fishes is the longest; range takes between 8 hours and 1 hour per use (r_birds longest)
        split up uses and or species input to speed up


 Step B: Create master input files for species, extracting the species by entity ID, HUCS, Elevation, Habitat, FIPS and
 STATEs
    From 7a_ TabulateUsage_MinMax
        1_CreateUsageOverlapTables_PolBoundaries_TabArea- add area and column and sums by fips and state then exports
        tables to Counties and state folder with all uses rather than use layer folder

        update 1C to pull in no adjustment, habitat, elevation and habitat and elevation by political boundaries

        run step 2 against each interation of files
