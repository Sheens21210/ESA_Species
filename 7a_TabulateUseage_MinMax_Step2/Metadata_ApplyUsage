# Extract row 0
# Transpose
# Extract corresponding vector from PCT table for use
# Transpose
# Join two df by state
# multiply into columns PCT	State adjusted by PCT
# out df by use
# long format  State	State overlap	PCT	  State adjusted by PCT

# Extract row 0
# Transpose
# join back to look up and add in State and ZoneID
# Sum to Species from Zone ID
# working df cols = species species overlap in state within range state
# join to output for current use from Step 1
# Calculate
#   Total outside species range: State - species in state
#   min in Species range	if total outside > state adjusted pct;0 else = state adjusted PCT -total outside
#   Max in species range if total total species < state adjusted pct; state adjust else = species overlap in state
#   uniform : pct * species overlap in state

# create three df one min max and uniform
# sum to species : now this is the same as the merge files for raw overlap
# calculate overlap

# Possible for drift overlap extract by drift value calc PCT save document _distance then merge back to single species
# by drift interval
